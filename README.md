# Child-Mind-Institute-Problematic-Internett-Use
This is a proposal of prediction of the level of problematic internet usage exhibited by children and adolescents, based on their physical activity. The goal of the competition is to develop a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity and fitness data to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Identifying these patterns can help trigger interventions to encourage healthier digital habits
